# MqttTask appliction 
#simple application that implemented the MQTT protocol with ios client using swift3.
#Switch 1 on  -> publish Hello message over specified Topic.
#Switch 1 off -> publish nothing.
#Switch 2 on  -> publish Bey message over specified Topic.
#Switch 2 off -> publish nothing.
#when a message is comming from a certain Topic that the ios client is subscribed to it will displayed on the label.




#for testing the application i used https://api.cloudmqtt.com which represent the MQTT sever (brocker).
#However you could see the result when you turnon/off any switch on the console but for reciving incomming message you should use brocker.
